   <font size="6">The Rainforest Action Network has been working since 1993 to protect 
   the Amazon one acre at a time. Its Protect An Acre grants have helped to support more than 200 front-line communities and Indigenous-led organisations as they work to protect millions of acres of forest around the world. Protect An Acre
   helps local activists regain control of sustainably managed traditional territories, and fight against human rights abuses frequently associated with logging, pulp 
   and paper mills, mining and other extractive industries.</font>

<font size="6">While many of the fires have been set to clear land for agribusiness, setting fires is also part of the process of extracting timber. Large areas are often burned to access trees for felling or to 
  create access to other areas of the forest. Reducing the amount of paper and wood we use is a good way to help reduce commercial pressures on the Amazon, as well as other forests. Where itâ€™s harder to reduce consumption, look for rainforest safe
  products with the help of the Rainforest Alliance.</font>
